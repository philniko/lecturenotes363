# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Data and *Big Data*

- Data is exploding and occurring along three main dimensions:
  - **Volume** or the amount of data
  - **Velocity** or the speed of data
  - **Variety** or the range of data types and sources
- What is **Big Data**?
  - The *proliferation* of data that floods organizations on a daily basis
  - It is *high volume*, *high velocity*, and/or *high variety*
  - Requires new forms of processing to enable *fast mining*, enhanced decision-making, insight discovery and process optimization

## Problem with Flat Files

- Scaling issues
- Integrity issues
- System recovery issues
- Concurrent edits to Files
- How to build another application?
- What if changes need to be made to how the data is physically stored?

## 1970s - Relational Data Model

- Programmers rewriting IMS code every time the database schema changes
- Abstract DBs to avoid this issue
  - Decouple logical structure from physical structure
  - Store DB in simple data structure
  - Use high-level language to access data
  - Physical storage is left to the DBMS implementation

## NoSQL Databases

- A new class of DBs emerged, which mainly follow the BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual Consistency)
  - These were dubbed NoSQL
  - Ex: *Amazon's Dynamo* and *Google's Bigtable*
- Main characteristics:
  - No strict schema requirements
  - No strict adherence to **ACID** properties
  - *Consistency* is traded in favor of *availability*
- Types:
  - Document Stores
  - Graph Databases
  - Key-Value Stores
  - Columnar Databases
