# Lecture 6: SQL - Part 1

## Relational Query Languages

- **Query languages** (QLs) allow *manipulating* and *retrieving* data from databases
- The relational model supports simple and powerful QLs:
  - Strong formal foundation based on logic
  - High amenability for effective optimizations

> [!WARNING]
> query languages != programming languages!
- QLs are not expected to *Turing complete*
- QLs are not intended to be used for complex calculations
- QLs support easy and efficient access to large datasets

## SQL Major Aspects

- Supports simple and powerful *querying* of data
- Most widely used commercial relational DB language
- Several aspects:
  1. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
      - Allows users to pose queries and insert, delete and modify *rows*
  2. **Data Definition Language (DLL)
      - Allows users to create, delete, and modify *tables and views*
  3. **Triggers and Advanced Integrity Constraints**
      - Supports **triggers**, which are actions executed by the DBMS whenever changes to the database meet conditions specified in triggers
  4. **Embedded and Dynamic Language**
      - Embedded SQL allows SQL code to be called from a *host language* (ex: Java)
  5. **Remote Database Access**
      - Allows connecting client programs to remote DB servers
  6. **Transaction Management**
      - Allows users to control aspects of how a transaction is to be executed (ex: later in the semester)
  7. **Security**
      - Provides mechanisms to control users' access to data objects (ex: tables and views)

## Basic SQL Queries

Basic form is as follows:
```sql
SELECT a1, a2, ..., an
FROM r1, r2, ..., rm
WHERE P
```

## Our Mini-U DB

**STUDENT**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | name | address |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | smith | main str |
| 234 | jones | guy street |

**CLASS**
| <ins>c_id</ins> | c_name | units |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 15-413 | s.e. | 2 |
| 15-412 | o.s. | 2 |

**TAKES**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | c_id | grade |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | 15-413 | A |
| 234 | 15-413 | B |

Find the ssn(s) of everybody called **smith**:
```sql
SELECT ssn
FROM student 
WHERE name='smith'
```

Find the ssn(s) of everybody called **smith** on **main str**:
```sql
SELECT ssn
FROM student
WHERE name ='smith' AND address='main str'
```

Find Students ssn(s) who live on **main** (ex: main st, main str, main street)
```sql
SELECT ssn
FROM student
WHERE address LIKE 'main%'
```
% &rarr; variable length *do note care* (stands for 0 or more arbitrary characters)\
_ &nbsp; &rarr; single character *do not care* (stands for any 1 character)

## Another Example of Pattern Matching

**SAILORS**
| sid | sname | rating | age |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | Dustin | 7 | 45.0 |
| 29 | Brutus | 1 | 33.0 |

Find the **ages** of sailors whose **names** *begin and end with* B and have at least 3 characters
```sql
SELECT S.age
FROM sailors S
WHERE S.sname LIKE 'B_%B'
```

## Cartesian Product vs Join

**STUDENT**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | name | address |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | smith | main str |
| 234 | jones | guy street |

**TAKES**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | c_id | grade |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | 15-413 | A |
| 234 | 15-413 | B |

**Cartesian Product**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT, TAKES
```

**Join**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM STUDENT AS S, TAKES AS T 
WHERE S.ssn =  T.ssn
```

**Find the names of students taking 15-415**:
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM STUDENT, TAKES 
WHERE STUDENT.ssn = TAKES.ssn ANDTAKES.c_id='15-415'

/* or */

SELECT name
FROM STUDENT AS S, TAKES AS T
WHERE S.ssn = T.ssn AND T.c_id = '15-415'
```

### Self-Joins

#### Example 1

**PC**
| p_id | c_id |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Mary | Tom |
| Peter | Mary |
| John | Tom |

**Find Tom's grandparents**:
```sql
SELECT gp.p_id
FROM PC AS gp, Product
WEHERE gp.c_id = PC.p_id AND PC.c_id = 'Tom'
```

#### Example 2

**Sailors**
| sid | sname | rating | age |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | Dustin | 7 | 45.0 |
| 29 | Brutus | 1 | 33.0 |

**Reserves**
| sid | bid | day |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | 101 | 10/10/2013 |
| 22 | 102 | 10/10/2013 |

Find names and increments by 1 for the ratings for the ratings of people who have sailed two different boats on the same day:
```sql
SELECT S.sname, S.rating + 1 AS rating -- increment rating by 1
FROM Sailors S, Reserves R1, Reserves R2
WHERE S.sid = R1.sid AND S.sid = R2.sid -- sailor sid same as sid in 2 reserves 
  AND R1.day = R2.day AND R1.bid != R2.bid -- same day boat id is different
```
