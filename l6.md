## Relational Query Languages

- **Query languages** (QLs) allow *manipulating* and *retrieving* data from databases
- The relational model supports simple and powerful QLs:
  - Strong formal foundation based on logic
  - High amenability for effective optimizations
  > [!WARNING]
  > query languages != programming languages!
