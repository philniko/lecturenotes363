# Lecture 9: SQL - Part 4

## Nested Queries with Set-Comparison Operators

| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | Dustin | 7 | 45.0 |
| 29 | Brutus | 1 | 33.0 |

Find sailors with the highest sid:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.sid >= ALL (SELECT S2.sid -- greater to or equal than -> if more than 1, return all
                    FROM Sailors S2)
```

Find sailors with the highest sid **without nested subquery**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Sailors S1, Sailors S2
WHERE S1.sid > S2.sid
/* This gives all BUT the smallest sid */
```
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Sailors S1, Sailors S2
WHERE S1.sid < S2.sid
/* This gives all BUT the highest sid */
```
### Revisit: Another Example

Find the names of sailors who have reserved both a red and a green boat:
```sql
(SELECT s.sname FROM Sailors S, Reserves R, Boats B
WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = B.bid AND B.color = 'green')
INTERSECT
(SELECT S2.sname FROM Sailors S2, Reserves R2, Boats B2
WHERE S2.sid = R2.sid AND R2.bid = B2.bid AND B2.color = 'red')
/* This query contains a bug, we are using sname to identify sailors,
   but sname is not a key for sailors */
```

Correct Way (nested query):
```sql
(SELECT s.sname FROM Sailors S, Reserves R, Boats B
WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = B.bid AND B.color = 'green')
AND S.sid IN
(SELECT S2.sname FROM Sailors S2, Reserves R2, Boats B2
WHERE S2.sid = R2.sid AND R2.bid = B2.bid AND B2.color = 'red')
/* similarly, queries using EXCEPT can be rewritten using NOT IN */
```

### Revisit: Another Example 2

Find the name and age of the oldest sailor:
```sql
SELECT S.sname, MAX(S.age)
FROM Sailors S
/* ILLEGAL in SQL, if SELECT clause uses an aggregate function,
   it must only use aggregate function unless the query contains
   a GROUP BY clause */
```

Correct Way:
```sql
SELECT S.sname, S.age
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.age = (SELECT MAX(S2.age)
               FROM Sailors S2)
```

### Revisit: Another Example 3

Find age of the youngest sailor with age >= 18, for each rating level with at least 2 such sailors:
```sql
SELECT S.rating, MIN(S.age) AS minage
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.age >= 18
GROUP BY S.rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

Alternative:
```sql
SELECT S.rating, MIN(S.age) AS minage
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.age >= 18
GROUP BY S.rating
HAVING 1 < (SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM Sailors S2
            WHERE S.rating = S2.rating)
/* the HAVING clause can include subqueries */
```

Another alternative:
```sql
SELECT Temp.rating, Temp.minage
FROM (SELECT S.rating, MIN(S.age) AS minage, COUNT(*) AS ratingcount
      FROM Sailors S
      WHERE S.age >= 18
      GROUP BY S.rating) AS Temp -- necessary
WHERE Temp.ratingcount > 1
/* the FROM clause can include subqueries */
```

## Reminder: Our Mini-U DB

**Student**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | name | address |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | smith | main str |
| 234 | jones | guy street |

**Class**
| <ins>c_id</ins> | c_name | units |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 15-413 | s.e. | 2 |
| 15-412 | o.s. | 2 |

**Takes**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | <ins>c_id</ins> | grade |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | 15-413 | A |
| 234 | 15-413 | B |

### Revisit: Insertions

```sql
INSERT INTO Students(ssn, name, address)
VALUES (123, 'smith', 'main')
-- or
INSERT INTO Student
VALUES (123, 'smith', 'main')
```

#### Bulk Insertions

How to insert, say, a table of **foreign_student**, in **bulk**?
```sql
INSERT INTO Student
SELECT ssn, name, address
FROM foreign_student
```

### Revisit: Deletions

Delete the record of **smith**:
```sql
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE name = 'smith'
/* deletes all smith's */
```

### Revisit: Updates

Update the grade to **A** for **ssn = 123** and **course 15-415**:
```sql
UPDATE Takes
SET grade='A'
WHERE ssn = 123 AND c_id = '15-415'
```

#### Updating Views

Consider the following view:
```sql
CREATE VIEW db_takes AS
(SELECT * FROM takes WHERE c_id = '15-415')
```

**Rule of thumb**: a command that affects a row in the view affects all corresponding rows in underlying tables!

> [!WARNING]
> Typically, we can ONLY update views that have no JOINs, nor aggregates
