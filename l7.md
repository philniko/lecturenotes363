# Lecture 7: SQL - Part 2

## Set Operations

Find ssn(s) of students taking both 15-415 <ins>**and**</ins> 15-413
```sql
select ssn from takes where c_id='15-415' and c_id='15-413'
/* this is wrong */
```
```sql
(SELECT ssn FROM takes WHERE c_id='15-415')
intersect
(SELECT ssn FROM takes WHERE c_id='15-413')
```

\
Find ssn(s) of students taking 15-415 <ins>**or**</ins> 15-413
```sql
(SELECT ssn FROM takes where c_id='15-415')
union
(SELECT ssn FROM takes WHERE c_id='15-413')
```

\
Find ssn(s) of students taking 15-415 <ins>**but not**</ins> 15-413

```sql
(SELECT ssn FROM takes WHERE c_id='15-415')
except
(SELECT ssn FROM takes WHERE c_id='15-413')
```

## Aggregate Functions

| <ins>ssn</ins> | <ins>c_id</ins> | grade |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | 15-413 | 4 |
| 234 | 15-413 | 3 |

Find average grade, across all students
```sql
SELECT AVG(grade) FROM takes
```

Find total number of enrollments
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM takes
```

Find total number of students in 15-415
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM takes WHERE c_id='15-415'
```

## GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

**Sailors**
| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | Dustin | 7 | 45.0 |
| 29 | Brutus | 1 | 33.0 |

Find the name and age of the oldest sailor
```sql
SELECT S.sname, MAX(S.age)
FROM Sailors S
/* illegal in sql */
```
> [!WARNING]
> If the **select** clause uses an **aggregate** function, it muse **ONLY** use aggregate function unless the query contains a **group by** clause!

\
Find the age of the youngest sailor for each rating level
  - In general, we do not konw how many rating levels exist, and what the rating values for these levels are
  - Suppose we know that rating values go from *1 to 10*; we can write 10 queries that look like this:
```sql
SELECT MIN(S.age)
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.rating = i
/* for i = 1, 2, ..., 10 */

SELECT S.rating, min(S.age)
FROM Sailors S
GROUP BY S.rating
/* solution using the GROUP BY clause
```
