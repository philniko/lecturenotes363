# Lecture 8: SQL - Part 3

## GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

**Sailors**
| sid | sname | rating | age |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | Dustin | 7 | 45.0 |
| 29 | Brutus | 1 | 33.0 |

Find age of the youngest sailor with age >= 18, for each rating level with at least 2 sailors:
```sql
SELECT S.rating, MIN(S.age) AS minage
FROM Sailors S
WHERE s.age >= 18
GROUP BY S.rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

Find age of the youngest sailor with age >= 18, for each rating level with at least 2 sailors, and with every sailor under 60:
```sql
SELECT S.rating, MIN(S.age) AS minage
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.age >= 18
GROUP BY S.rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND EVERY(S.age <= 60)
```

Find age of the youngest sailor with age >= 18, for each rating level with at least 2 sailors between 18 and 60:
```sql
SELECT S.rating, MIN(S.age) AS minage
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.age >= 18 AND S.age <= 60
GROUP BY S.rating
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

## The ORDER BY Clause

Find student records, sorted in name order:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY name ASC
```

## More Examples

**takes**
| <ins>ssn</ins> | <ins>c-id</ins> | grade |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 123 | 15-413 | 4 |
| 234 | 15-413 | 3 |

Find the total number of students in each course:
```sql
SELECT c_id, COUNT(*)
FROM takes
GROUP BY c_id
```

Find total number of students in each course, and sort by count, in decreasing order:
```sql
SELECT c_id, count(*) as pop
FROM takes
GROUP BY c_id
ORDER BY pop DESC
```

## A Join Query

**Sailors**
| <ins>sid</ins> | sname | rating | age |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | Dustin | 7 | 45.0 |
| 29 | Brutus | 1 | 33.0 |

**Reserves**
| <ins>sid</ins> | bid | day |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 22 | 101 | 10/10/2013 |
| 22 | 102 | 10/10/2013 |

Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 101:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S, Reserves R
WHERE S.sid = R.sid AND R.bid = 101
```

## Nested Queries

Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 101:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.sid IN (SELECT R.sid
                FROM Reserves R
                WHERE R.bid=101)
```

Find the names of sailors who have **not** reserved boat 101:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.sid NOT IN (SELECT R.sid
                FROM Reserves R
                WHERE R.bid=101)
```

### Deeply Nested Queries

Adding **Boats** table:

**Boats**
| <ins>bid</ins> | bname | color |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 101 | interlake | red |
| 102 | clipper | green |

Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red boat:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.sid IN (SELECT R.sid
                FROM Reserves R
                WHERE R.bid IN (SELECT B.bid
                                FROM Boats B
                                WHERE B.color = 'red'))
```

### Correlated Nested Queries

Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 101:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * -- allows us to test whether a set is "nonempty"
              FROM Reserves R
              WHERE R.bid = 101
              AND R.sid = S.sid) -- correlation
```

Find the names of sailors who have **not** reserved boat 101:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
              FROM Reserves R
              WHERE R.bid = 101
              AND R.sid = S.sid)

```

### Nested Queries with Set-Comparison Operators

Find sailors whose rating is better than <ins>some</ins> sailor called Dustin:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.rating > ANY (SELECT S2.rating
                      FROM Sailors S2
                      WHERE S2.name = 'Dustin')
  /* If no sailor called Dustin, empty set is returned */
```

Find sailors whose rating is better than <ins>every</ins> sailor called Dustin:
```sql
SELECT S.sname
FROM Sailors S
WHERE S.rating > ALL (SELECT S2.rating
                      FROM Sailors S2
                      WHERE S2.name = 'Dustin')
  /* If no sailor called Dustin, names of all sailors is returned */
```

## Concluding Remarks

- SQL was an important factor in the early acceptance of the relational model
  - It is more natural than earlier procedural query languages
- SQL is relationally complete; in fact; significantly more expressive power than relational algebra
- Even queries that can be expressed in relational algebra can often be expressed more naturally in SQL
